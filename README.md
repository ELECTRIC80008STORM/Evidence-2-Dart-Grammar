## Description

For this Evidence I choose Dart as the base language from where I’m going to extract my grammars.

Dart is a client-optimized (meaning, it was designed to perform well on client-side applications, like web browsers, mobile apps and desktop applications) programming language developed by Google. The importance of choosing Dart over other languages for me comes from Dart being the language used for Flutter, Google’s UI toolkit for crafting natively compiled applications for mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase. It can help me better understand the basics of how Flutter works which in turn can improve my understanding and handling of the toolkit.
